What's the point?
=================
2MIDI is a balls-on accurate MOD to MIDI file converter, it doesn't
just stick the notes into a MIDI file. It also converts the effects
and instrument info (volume/pan envelopes etc...) to make an exact
MIDI copy of the MOD (assuming there are enough MIDI channels). 2MIDI
supports the MOD/MTM/S3M/XM/IT file formats.


Main Features
=============
* Balls-on accurate
  makes exact MIDI copies of MODs

* Effects conversion
  converts all MOD effects into MIDI

* Instrument conversion
  switchable vol/pan envelope & vibrato handling for each sample

* MOD channel and sample based MIDI channel assignment
  mix'n'match channel and sample based assignment for max flexibility

* Prioritization
  4 different prioritization methods are used

* WAV/IFF/PAT/XI/SF2/DLS samples
  export samples/instruments in any of these formats

* Optimizations
  silent note removal, note length trimming, channel sharing

* Volume/pan/pitch resolution
  reduces the MIDI file size with minimal loss in quality

* Drum channel
  use the drum channel for conversion of notes with no FX applied

* Effect translation
  translate MOD effects into MIDI controllers/meta-events

* Custom keyboard shortcuts
  assign any key to any button or switch
